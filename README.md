# Addition and subtraction worksheet generator

This mini-app generates a PDF arithmetic worksheet that helps kids to do addition and subtraction.
The number of digits, and also the chance to have carry digit & borrowing in the calculation can be configured.
(The chance cannot be set over 70% to avoid kids drilling the wrong way.)

Note: sadly the project cannot be built now because the code base was unmaintained for years.
