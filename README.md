# Addition and subtraction worksheet generator

This mini-app generates a PDF arithmetic worksheet that helps kids to do addition and subtraction.
The number of digits, and also the chance to have carry digit & borrowing in the calculation can be configured.
(The chance cannot be set over 70% to avoid kids drilling the wrong way.)

[Open the app](https://lwchkg.github.io/arith_ws_gen/)

P.S. for Android, Firefox is recommended because it comes with an internal PDF viewer.

Note: sadly the project cannot be built now because the code base was unmaintained for years.
I did not have the time to add features like model answers and page layout (paper size, header, etc.)
